> in the folder split, the file count.c, the function count_token explain the flow line by line ] 

● I'll read the count.c file to examine the count_token function and explain its flow line by line.

● Read(src/split/count.c)
  ⎿  Read 90 lines

● I'll explain the count_tokens function flow line by line (lines 69-89 in src/split/count.c):

  Function: count_tokens - Line-by-Line Flow

  Lines 71-75: Variable Declarations
  int     i;           // Index to traverse the input string
  int     count;       // Counter for the number of tokens found
  int     in_quotes;   // Flag: 1 if currently inside quotes, 0 otherwise
  int     in_word;     // Flag: 1 if currently processing a word, 0 otherwise
  char    quote_char;  // Stores which quote character (' or ") opened the current quote

  Lines 77-80: Initialization
  - Line 77: i = 0 - Start at the beginning of the string
  - Line 78: count = 0 - No tokens counted yet
  - Line 79: in_quotes = 0 - Not inside quotes initially
  - Line 80: in_word = 0 - Not inside a word initially

  Lines 81-85: Main Loop
  - Line 81: while (str[i]) - Loop through each character until null terminator
  - Line 83: handle_char(str, &i, &count, &in_quotes, &quote_char, &in_word) - Process the current
  character, updating all state variables (count, quote status, word status). This function handles:
    - Opening quotes (starts a new token if not already in a word)
    - Closing quotes (ends quote mode)
    - Operators (|, <, >, <<, >>) - each counts as a separate token
    - Whitespace (ends current word)
    - Regular characters (starts a new word/token if not already in one)
  - Line 84: i++ - Move to the next character

  Lines 86-88: Error Handling and Return
  - Line 86-87: if (in_quotes) return (-1) - If we're still inside quotes at the end of the string, it
   means there's an unclosed quote error, so return -1
  - Line 88: return (count) - Return the total number of tokens counted

  Summary

  The function counts how many tokens exist in a shell command string by:
  1. Iterating through each character
  2. Tracking whether we're inside quotes or words
  3. Counting new tokens when encountering: operators, quote-delimited strings, or space-separated
  words
  4. Returning -1 if quotes are unclosed, otherwise returning the count

> echo "hello" "word"                                                                                 
                                                      go with ths case in the flow of cont tokens to 
check how is it being retrunign the cont 

● I'll trace through the count_tokens function with the input echo "hello" "word" step by step to show
   how it returns the count.

  Input: echo "hello" "word"

  Let me trace through character by character:

  Initial State:

  - i = 0, count = 0, in_quotes = 0, in_word = 0

  Character-by-Character Flow:

  i=0, char='e':
  - Not in quotes, not an operator, not whitespace
  - It's a regular character and in_word = 0
  - Lines 59-65: Increment count to 1, set in_word = 1
  - State: count=1, in_word=1, in_quotes=0

  i=1, char='c':
  - Not in quotes, regular character, already in_word = 1
  - No count change
  - State: count=1, in_word=1, in_quotes=0

  i=2, char='h':
  - Same as above
  - State: count=1, in_word=1, in_quotes=0

  i=3, char='o':
  - Same as above
  - State: count=1, in_word=1, in_quotes=0

  i=4, char=' ' (space):
  - Not in quotes, whitespace detected (line 57-58)
  - Set in_word = 0
  - State: count=1, in_word=0, in_quotes=0

  i=5, char='"' (first quote):
  - Not in quotes, quote character detected (line 51)
  - Calls handle_quote_start (lines 24-34)
    - in_word = 0, so increment count to 2 (line 29)
    - Set in_word = 1 (line 30)
    - Set quote_char = '"' (line 32)
    - Set in_quotes = 1 (line 33)
  - State: count=2, in_word=1, in_quotes=1, quote_char='"'

  i=6-10, chars='h','e','l','l','o':
  - Inside quotes (in_quotes = 1)
  - Line 53 checks if closing quote - NO
  - No other conditions match, just continue
  - State: count=2, in_word=1, in_quotes=1

  i=11, char='"' (closing quote):
  - Inside quotes and matches quote_char (line 53)
  - Set in_quotes = 0 (line 54)
  - State: count=2, in_word=1, in_quotes=0

  i=12, char=' ' (space):
  - Not in quotes, whitespace (line 57-58)
  - Set in_word = 0
  - State: count=2, in_word=0, in_quotes=0

  i=13, char='"' (opening second quote):
  - Not in quotes, quote character (line 51)
  - Calls handle_quote_start
    - in_word = 0, so increment count to 3 (line 29)
    - Set in_word = 1 (line 30)
    - Set quote_char = '"' (line 32)
    - Set in_quotes = 1 (line 33)
  - State: count=3, in_word=1, in_quotes=1, quote_char='"'

  i=14-17, chars='w','o','r','d':
  - Inside quotes
  - No count change
  - State: count=3, in_word=1, in_quotes=1

  i=18, char='"' (closing quote):
  - Inside quotes and matches quote_char (line 53)
  - Set in_quotes = 0 (line 54)
  - State: count=3, in_word=1, in_quotes=0

  i=19, char='\0' (null terminator):
  - Loop exits (line 81)

  Final Check (lines 86-88):

  - in_quotes = 0 (quotes are properly closed)
  - Return count = 3

  Result: 3 tokens

  The three tokens are:
  1. echo
  2. "hello"
  3. "word"

  Each quoted string is treated as a single token, and the command word echo is the first token.
