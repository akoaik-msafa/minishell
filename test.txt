bash zsh fish to see if it works well
increment SHELVEL at every execution
./minishel and minishell should work becaues ./minishell we have the binary file and minishell in PATH

only increse in expor , env keep the parent SHELVEL

env and export can have different values for the same variable
export shows what gets exported to child processes
env shows the current environment
