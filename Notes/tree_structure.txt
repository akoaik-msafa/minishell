/*
 * WHY DO WE NEED THIS TREE STRUCTURE?
 * ===================================
 * 
 * Consider: "cat file.txt | head -5 | tail -2"
 * 
 * The execution order matters:
 * 1. Start cat file.txt
 * 2. Pipe its output to head -5  
 * 3. Pipe head's output to tail -2
 * 
 * Tree representation:
 *           PIPE
 *          /    \
 *       PIPE    tail
 *      /    \
 *    cat    head
 * 
 * This tree tells us exactly how to execute: 
 * - Start from the left (cat)
 * - Connect each level with pipes
